            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman; May 24, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter, author, and visual artist who has been a major figure in 
                popular culture for more than fifty years. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when songs such as "Blowin' in the Wind" (1963)
                and "The Times They Are a-Changin'" (1964) became anthems for the civil rights movement and anti-war movement. His lyrics during this period 
                incorporated a wide range of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences, defied pop-music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning
                counterculture.<br>
                In July 1966, Dylan withdrew from touring after being injured in a motorcycle accident. During this period, he recorded a large body of songs with 
                members of the Band, who had previously backed him on tour. These recordings were released as the collaborative album The Basement Tapes in 1975. 
                In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dylan explored country music and rural themes in John Wesley Harding (1967), Nashville Skyline (1969), and New Morning
                (1970). In 1975, he released Blood on the Tracks, which many saw as a return to form. In the late 1970s, he became a born-again Christian and released 
                a series of albums of contemporary gospel music before returning to his more familiar rock-based idiom in the early 1980s. The major works of his later
                career include Time Out of Mind (1997), Love and Theft (2001), Modern Times (2006) and Tempest (2012). His most recent recordings have comprised versions
                of traditional American standards, especially songs recorded by Frank Sinatra. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the 
                late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour.</p>
